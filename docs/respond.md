Respond to Message
------------------

Introduction
============

There are two types of responses to messages:
* Acknowledge, which happens when we think that the user has seen the message, for example because it has been displayed to the user for 2 seconds (see NGC-1389).
* Answer, which happens when a user explicitly provides an answer to a message, for example by pressing a button to choose a response.
